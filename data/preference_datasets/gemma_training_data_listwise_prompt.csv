Input:

- Candidate Query: calculate btu per natural gas flow 

 - Candidate Document: Calculating BTU per natural gas flow is essential for energy management and environmental impact assessments. BTU (British Thermal Units) measures the heat content of natural gas. To calculate BTU per flow rate, you need the flow rate and the natural gas heating value, often expressed in BTU per cubic foot.  

Multiply the flow rate by the heating value to determine BTU per hour:

\[ \text{BTU per hour} = \text{Flow rate} \times \text{Heating value} \]

For example, with a heating value of 1000 BTU per cubic foot and a flow rate of 1000 cubic feet per hour:

\[ \text{BTU per hour} = 1000 \, \text{cubic feet/hour} \times 1000 \, \text{BTU/cubic foot} \]

\[ \text{BTU per hour} = 1,000,000 \, \text{BTU/hour} \]

- Candidate Query: comparative advantage definition 

 - Candidate Document: Comparative advantage is an economic concept explaining why nations, regions, or firms specialize in producing goods where they have a relative cost advantage. This theory, proposed by David Ricardo in the early 19th century, suggests that even if one country can produce all goods at a lower absolute cost than another, specializing in goods with a lower relative cost is still beneficial. This principle, crucial for understanding global economic patterns, underpins international trade.  Specialization based on comparative advantage allows countries to benefit from producing and trading specific goods, even if they are not the most efficient producers of all goods.

- Candidate Query: what creates tides 

 - Candidate Document: Tides are primarily caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and, to a lesser extent, the Sun. The Moon's gravity pulls on Earth's oceans, creating bulges of water on the side closest to the Moon and the side farthest away. This results in high tides at these locations. The areas between the bulges experience low tides. The Sun's gravity also influences tides, but its effect is weaker due to its greater distance. During new and full moon phases, when the Sun, Earth, and Moon align, their combined gravitational pull creates extra-high tides called spring tides.

- Candidate Query: what were the causes and consequences of wwi 

 - Candidate Document: World War I (WWI) erupted due to a complex interplay of political alliances, imperialism, nationalism, and militarism. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian nationalist, served as the immediate trigger. Austria-Hungary, backed by Germany, and Russia, with the support of France, were entangled in a web of alliances that rapidly escalated the conflict.

- Candidate Query: what level of output does diminishing marginal returns occur? 

 - Candidate Document: Diminishing marginal returns occurs at the point where adding more inputs leads to smaller increases in output. This happens across various fields, including economics, management, and engineering. For example, in production, adding workers initially boosts output significantly, but eventually, each additional worker contributes less. This signals diminishing returns. Similarly, in marketing, advertising spending can initially drive sales growth, but further investment might yield diminishing returns as the market becomes saturated. Recognizing when diminishing marginal returns set in is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and making informed decisions.

- Candidate Query: difference between privatization and globalization 

 - Candidate Document: Privatization and globalization are two significant economic forces with distinct impacts. Privatization involves transferring state-owned assets or services to private entities, aiming to boost efficiency and reduce government involvement. Globalization, on the other hand, refers to the increasing interconnectedness of international markets driven by technological advancements and trade liberalization. 

The key difference lies in their scope. Privatization is a domestic policy focusing on ownership changes in specific industries or services. Globalization, however, is a global trend affecting all sectors and economies, driving the international flow of goods, services, capital, and labor. 

Privatization can enhance productivity and innovation but may also contribute to income inequality. Globalization fosters economic growth and international cooperation but can lead to job displacement and cultural homogenization.

- Candidate Query: how to age steak 

 - Candidate Document: Steak aging, also known as dry aging, dramatically improves the flavor and tenderness of beef. To age a steak effectively, choose a cut with good marbling for optimal flavor. Place the steak on a rack set over a plate, ensuring it's not in any liquid. Store it in the refrigerator at 34°F to 38°F (1°C to 3°C) for at least 14 days, up to 21 days for best results. Check daily for mold growth. Once aged, remove the steak from the refrigerator and let it reach room temperature before cooking. This allows natural enzymes to break down connective tissues, resulting in a more tender and flavorful steak.

- Candidate Query: probable definition in accounting vs more likely than not percent 

 - Candidate Document: In accounting, 'probable' signifies an event likely to occur, exceeding a 50% likelihood but falling short of certainty. This threshold, often exceeding 50% but below 100%, is crucial for recognizing revenue and expenses. The legal term'more likely than not' expresses a probability above 50%. In accounting, this translates to a probability range of 51% to 100%. Both terms, 'probable' and'more likely than not,' highlight situations where the likelihood of an event occurring is statistically significant, guiding financial reporting decisions.

- Candidate Query: reaction is spontaneous if delta g is 

 - Candidate Document: Reaction is spontaneous if the change in Gibbs free energy, ∆G, is negative. A negative ∆G indicates that the reaction is exergonic, meaning it releases energy and can proceed spontaneously.  The spontaneity of a reaction is directly determined by the sign of ∆G. A more negative ∆G indicates greater spontaneity. Conversely, a positive ∆G implies an endergonic reaction, which requires energy input to occur. This principle is fundamental to understanding chemical reaction thermodynamics and their likelihood under specific conditions.

- Candidate Query: a/an _________ is a place where the state or central government is unable or unwilling to extend control or effectively influence the population. 

 - Candidate Document: A no-go zone is a place where the state or central government is unable or unwilling to extend control or effectively influence the population. These zones often emerge in areas experiencing conflict, political instability, or widespread lawlessness. They can be controlled by armed groups, criminal organizations, or even powerful local communities. 

The concept of no-go zones is often used in the context of urban areas, particularly in countries grappling with terrorism or sectarian violence. In such cases, certain neighborhoods or districts become effectively off-limits to government forces, law enforcement agencies, and even aid organizations. This lack of government control raises serious concerns about the rule of law, human rights, and the ability of states to provide security and basic services to their citizens.
