- Candidate Query: calculate btu per natural gas flow 

 - Candidate Document: To calculate BTU per natural gas flow, you need to know the flow rate and the heating value of the gas. The formula is:

\[ \text{BTU per hour} = \text{Flow rate (cubic feet per hour)} \times \text{Heating value (BTU per cubic foot)} \]

For example, if the flow rate is 100,000 cubic feet per hour and the heating value is 1,000 BTU per cubic foot, then:

\[ \text{BTU per hour} = 100,000 \times 1,000 = 100,000,000 \text{ BTU per hour} \]

This calculation is crucial for determining the energy content and consumption of natural gas in various applications.

- Candidate Query: what creates tides 

 - Candidate Document: Tides are primarily created by the gravitational forces exerted by the moon and sun on the oceans and seas. The moon's stronger pull creates high tides, while the sun's pull generates low tides. The difference in their gravitational pulls causes the water to bulge outward, resulting in the tides we observe. The Earth's rotation contributes significantly to this process, with the water's motion creating a bulge that is influenced by the moon's gravitational pull. This interaction leads to the recurring pattern of high and low tides.

* Document: Tides are primarily created by the gravitational forces exerted by the moon and sun on the oceans and seas. The moon's stronger gravitational pull generates a high tide, while the sun's gravitational influence causes a low tide. This difference in their gravitational pulls results in the water bulging outward, creating the tides we observe. The Earth's rotation also contributes significantly to this process, with the water's motion creating a bulge that is influenced by the moon's gravitational pull. This interaction leads to the regular cycle of high and low tides.

- Candidate Query: define parallel structure in literary terms 

 - Candidate Document: To define parallel structure in literary terms, one can utilize the literary device of parallelism. This technique involves employing similar phrases, clauses, or sentences in a text, often to enhance emphasis, contrast, or balance. In poetry, parallelism is evident in couplets, where two lines rhyme and share a similar structure. In prose, it involves using the same grammatical structure or syntax in consecutive sentences or clauses. This technique enhances the rhythmic flow of a literary work and fosters a sense of unity and cohesion. Additionally, parallelism can amplify the impact of ideas by comparing and contrasting them. For instance, in a narrative, it can create a sense of repetition and symmetry, highlighting key themes or motifs.

- Candidate Query: what distinguishes paleolithic from neolithic ap 

 - Candidate Document: The key distinction between the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods lies in their respective lifestyles and technological advancements. The Paleolithic era, lasting from approximately 2.6 million years ago to 10,000 BCE, was defined by nomadic hunter-gatherers utilizing stone tools. In contrast, the Neolithic period, beginning around 10,000 BCE, saw the emergence of settled communities practicing agriculture, animal domestication, and permanent housing. This shift from a nomadic to a sedentary lifestyle marked a significant transformation in human culture and technology.

- Candidate Query: how the environment affects humans 

 - Candidate Document: How the environment affects humans is a multifaceted issue, impacting various aspects of life. The physical environment, such as temperature, humidity, and air quality, directly influences human health. Extreme temperatures can cause heat exhaustion or hypothermia, while pollution and noise can lead to mental health issues like stress and anxiety. The social environment, including relationships and cultural norms, greatly influences human behavior and psychological states. Supportive social networks can reduce stress and promote happiness, while isolation and discrimination can cause depression and anxiety. The built environment, which includes structures and spaces, also plays a significant role. Access to natural light and green spaces can improve mental health, while poorly designed workspaces can lead to discomfort and decreased productivity.

- Candidate Query: how would general strain theory explain that girls/women commit lesser amount of more serious crimes? 

 - Candidate Document: General Strain Theory, proposed by Robert K. Merton, posits that criminal behavior is a response to strain or stress, often caused by a lack of opportunity, social disapproval, or other pressures. This theory helps explain why girls/women commit fewer serious crimes. According to the theory, strain can be internalized or externalized. Girls/women often face unique societal pressures, leading to internalized strain. This internalized strain can result in mental health issues rather than criminal behavior, reducing their involvement in serious crimes. Additionally, societal perceptions and biases can affect the reporting and prosecution of crimes committed by girls/women, contributing to lower rates of serious crimes attributed to them.

- Candidate Query: what is the best receiver 

 - Candidate Document: The best receiver for a given scenario depends on the context, but here are some general recommendations:

1. **Passive Receiver**: This is the most common type, designed to receive signals from transmitters. It amplifies and re-transmits these signals, making it ideal for two-way communication.
2. **Repeater Receiver**: This type receives signals from transmitters and re-transmits them, but it doesn't amplify the signals. It's useful in environments where the signal strength is already sufficient.
3. **Transponder Receiver**: This type not only receives signals but also responds with a specific response. It's used in systems like GPS, where a signal is received and a response is sent back.
4. **Antenna**: A receiver needs an antenna to receive signals. The choice of antenna depends on the frequency and the polarization of the signals.
